Camp GLOW, which stands for Girls Leading Our World, was first started in Romania in 1995 and has spread to most countries that host the Peace Corps. In Macedonia, it started in 2000 and has become a highly esteemed institution. Every year, hundreds of girls ages 14-18 apply and 80 of the best and brightest of Macedonia join PCVs and Host Country Nationals (HCNs) for one week of training, fun, and female empowerment. Without a doubt, my week at Camp GLOW was the most rewarding experience of my service thus far. <br/><br/>GLOW is special on many levels, but primarily because it provides a safe space for young women to explore their identities and find both inner-strength and strength from their female peers. It creates a community of love, understanding, and support. For many of the attendees, GLOW is the first time in their lives that they will interact with others of different backgrounds, whether on ethnic, religious, or socioeconomic lines. Furthermore, the campers attend classes all week that encourage leadership initiatives in their communities back home. GLOW is not about one week; rather, it is intended to set a precedent for the rest of these young women’s lives. </p><p>My role at camp was to work as an instructor, meaning that I taught a series core classes and electives throughout the week. These classes included Human Rights, Healthy Relationships, Stereotypes, Democracy, Women in Power, and, of course, Karaoke. With the exception of Karaoke, these are all subjects that were part of my degree focus during college; accordingly, I am very passionate about them. Having the opportunity to teach this material in an interactive manner to a group of open and receptive young women was the greatest privilege of my teaching career. I witnessed an incredible amount of growth in campers and constantly heard throughout the week that they had finally embraced their identity as a strong female. That achievement is immeasurable. </p><p>The campers, however, are not the only ones who achieve personal growth. All staff members, both PCVs and HCNs, learned valuable lessons and were touched by the campers. In fact, during our closing ceremony, we were all one big blubbery mess of crying women as the campers detailed their journeys throughout the week.   <br/><br/>On a personal level, I did not realize how much I needed the idealism of GLOW in my life before I began teaching that week. For those of you who know me, politics is my bread and butter. I am a junkie for following global affairs. With that, though, can come disillusionment and a staunchly realist perspective on life. Even though I work as a PCV, which is about as idealistic of a position as they come, I had grown bitter with the ways of the world without even realizing the shift I had made.  While a sense of realism has its own value, I had lost a lot of the excitement and hope that used to fill me when I was first immersed in global affairs. I realized towards the end of the camp that there was one overall message that I kept pushing in my various classes:<i> </i></p><blockquote><p><i>These problems that we face, they can be overcome. Things can change and that change starts with you. It starts with as small of a step as attending GLOW, finding your voice, and sharing your voice within your community. Change has never happened overnight; rather, it happens in baby steps. Simple actions in your daily life</i>.<i> Start with YOU and the rest will follow.</i>   </p></blockquote><p>That message was one of hope and idealism at its core. It was a message that I needed to apply to my own life and work, and I am incredibly grateful these young women helped me rediscover it. <br/><br/>Camp GLOW 2015 has come to a close, but I am looking forward to continuing its ideals here in Berovo. Four girls from Berovo attended the camp and together, we’ll be starting a Club GLOW, which takes the lessons of the camp and opens them to local communities across Macedonia. This time around, though, the young women will step up to the plate and become the new leaders in town. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"640\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://36.media.tumblr.com/ecd82c1a42c5334628cf8a31858df4e1/tumblr_inline_nslzlhUoIJ1so3qfp_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"640\"/></figure></blockquote>",
